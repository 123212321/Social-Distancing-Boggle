# Social-Distancing-Boggle
A Boggle Game Board that can be used while videoconferencing.

This is meant to be a bound code to Google Sheets.  The Boggle board is cells A1:D4.
Cells A5:A6 has a button which calls initializeDice and Cells B5:B6 has a button that calls
boggleTimer.  The time left is shown in D6.  Finally, I created a third button which brings
up a window with a dictionary to show the definition of the word in B8.

After creating the Google Sheet, share it with the other players.  Then, each player can
bring up the Boggle board on any device and everyone will see the same board.  So far, I
have only gotten the buttons to work on a computer, not on my cell phone.  Also, only 
players with edit permission can press the buttons.

Now we can play traditional Boggle together while keeping a safe social distance during
COVID-19 Pandemic.
