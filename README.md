# Social-Distancing-Boggle
A Boggle Game Board that can be used while videoconferencing.

Basic Directions:

This is meant to be a bound code to Google Sheets. First you need to create the Boggle board in Google Sheets.  Then copy the Boggle Game javascript code into the spreadsheet script window.  Finally connect the buttons on the spreadsheet to the appropriate functions in the script.  To play, share the link for the Google Sheet with all the players.  Only players on a computer logged into a google account can roll the dice and set the timer, but all players can see the gameboard

How to set up the Google Sheet
The Boggle board is cells A1:D4.  Set 
Cells A5:A6 has a button which calls initializeDice and Cells B5:B6 has a button that calls
boggleTimer.  The time left is shown in D6.  Finally, I created a third button which brings
up a window with a dictionary to show the definition of the word in B8.

After creating the Google Sheet, share it with the other players.  Then, each player can
bring up the Boggle board on any device and everyone will see the same board.  So far, I
have only gotten the buttons to work on a computer, not on my cell phone.  Also, only 
players with edit permission can press the buttons.

Now we can play traditional Boggle together while keeping a safe social distance during
COVID-19 Pandemic.
